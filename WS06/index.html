        <h2>The Thirty Years' War</h2>
        <p>The Thirty Years' War, 
            from 1618 to 1648, 
            was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. 
            Fought primarily in Central Europe, 
            an estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died from the effects of battle, 
            famine, or disease, while parts of Germany reported population declines of over 50%. 
            Related conflicts include the Eighty Years' War, 
            the War of the Mantuan Succession, the Franco-Spanish War, 
            the Torstenson War, the Dutch-Portuguese War, and the Portuguese Restoration War.
        </p>
        <p>
            The war can be seen as a continuation of the religious conflict 
            initiated by the 16th-century Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire. 
            The 1555 Peace of Augsburg attempted to resolve this by dividing the Empire 
            into Catholic and Lutheran states, but over the next 50 years the expansion 
            of Protestantism beyond these boundaries destabilised the settlement. 
            However, while differences over religion and Imperial authority were important 
            factors in causing the war, some contemporary commentators suggest its scope 
            and extent were driven by the contest for European dominance between Habsburg-ruled 
            Spain and Austria, and the French House of Bourbon.
        </p>  
        <p>
            Its outbreak is generally traced to 1618, when Emperor Ferdinand II was deposed 
            as king of Bohemia and replaced by the Protestant Frederick V of the Palatinate. 
            Although Imperial forces quickly suppressed the Bohemian Revolt, 
            Frederick's participation expanded the fighting into the Palatinate, 
            whose strategic importance drew in the Dutch Republic and Spain, 
            then engaged in the Eighty Years' War. In addition, the acquisition of 
            territories within the empire by rulers like Christian IV of Denmark and 
            Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden gave them and other foreign powers an ongoing motive 
            to intervene. Combined with fears the Protestant religion in general was threatened, 
            what started as an internal dynastic dispute became a European conflict.
        </p>  
        <p>
            The period from 1618 to 1635 was primarily a civil war within the Holy Roman Empire, 
            with support from external powers. After 1635, the empire became one theatre in a wider 
            struggle between France, chiefly supported by Sweden, and Emperor Ferdinand III, whose 
            principal ally was Spain. Fighting ended with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the 
            terms of which included greater autonomy within the empire for states like Bavaria and 
            Saxony, as well as acceptance of Dutch independence by Spain. The conflict shifted the 
            balance of power in favour of France, and set the stage for the expansionist wars of 
            Louis XIV which dominated Europe for the next sixty years.
